## Installation Instructions ‚Äî Build Your Trainer-Style Stack üõ†Ô∏è

### 1) Display Calibration (2 minutes)

* Set **brightness** so underground roots and leaf shadows are visible without bleaching daytime sky.
* Keep **color temperature** neutral; extreme warm/cool tints make berries, mushrooms, and armor tones blend.

### 2) In-Game Video Tweaks

* **Off:** Motion Blur, Film Grain, heavy Chromatic Aberration, Vignette.
* **Anti-Aliasing:** Pick a balanced mode; avoid extra-soft profiles that smear micro-detail.
* **Sharpen:** Light to moderate; define edges, not halos.
* **FOV:** Raise for awareness; keep scoped/aim rules consistent so ranged tracking remains natural.
* **Effects Quality:** If sparks/webbing hide silhouettes, drop one notch for visibility.
* **Upscaling:** If you use it, give built-in sharpness a tiny nudge and test for shimmer.

### 3) GPU/Monitor Filters (subtle > extreme)

* Add **moderate vibrance** and a touch of **contrast** so insects and loot gleam separate from foliage.
* If filters exist, test a gentle **clarity + contrast + slight exposure** combo in mixed lighting (sun, shade, water).

### 4) HUD & Minimap Discipline

* Enlarge minimap and set a **zoom** that catches patrols and forks without overwhelming the screen.
* Use **high-contrast waypoint colors**; reserve icons for essentials (labs, sap taps, fiber loops, boss prep base).
* Keep crosshair simple; busy reticles bury headboxes in particle effects.

### 5) Audio Imaging (your legal wall-sense)

* Choose an EQ that **reduces muddy lows** and preserves **mids** (steps, wing beats, chew clicks).
* Avoid heavy dynamic compression that buries distance cues.
* Test near water and dense grass; adjust so directionality stays clear.

### 6) Controls, Sensitivity & Binds

* Align **hipfire and ADS** feel so micro-corrections land at any zoom.
* Aim for **low-to-mid eDPI** to track strafing bugs smoothly.
* **Hotbar lanes:**

  1. melee, 2) ranged, 3) block/parry, 4) heals, 5) throwable, 6) light, 7) build tool, 8‚Äì10) situational.
* Pin **favorite recipes** (bandages, arrows, repair glue) and keep mats in consistent chests‚Äîhands will autopilot.

### 7) Custom Difficulty & Practice Presets

* Create **Practice** and **Adventure** presets.

  * *Practice:* lower creature damage and stamina drain to learn perfect blocks and attack chains.
  * *Adventure:* restore defaults for real runs once timing feels free.
* Save **Day**, **Night**, and **Boss** profiles with different brightness, sharpen, and minimap sizes.

### 8) Build & Route Optimization

* **Triangle base network:** main hub + two minis covering sap, water, lab path.
* **Ziplines** that return uphill; resource hauls become safe speedruns.
* **Lamp chokepoints** along tall grass corridors so nighttime patrols aren‚Äôt jump-scares.
* Drop **temporary markers** when diving deep; yank on exit to keep the map clean.

## Pro Tips That Feel Like a Trainer üß†

* **Angle Slicing:** Clear one bush lane at a time; fewer open angles = fewer surprise bites.
* **Light Advantage:** Fight from bright into dark; your silhouette hides while theirs pops.
* **Info Rhythm:** After a harvest or hit: **glance minimap ‚Üí reposition**. Patterns reveal patrol routes like clockwork.
* **Stamina Stacking:** Enter fights topped up; plan dodge windows around combo ends, not beginnings.
* **Kit Discipline:** Keep heals and torches on the same slots every session; repetition turns panic into autopilot.
* **Scouting Laps:** Do a zero-loot lap on new biomes just to place lamps and zips‚Äîthen return heavy.
